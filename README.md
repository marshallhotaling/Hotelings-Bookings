## Test Files Organization

Similar to feature code, your test code needs to be put in a specific place for it to run successfully.

**Put all of your test files in the `test` directory.** As a convention, all test filenames should end with `-test.js`. For instance: `box-test.js`.

## Running Your Tests

Run your test suite using the command:

```bash
npm test
```

The test results will output to the terminal.

## Webpack?

If you look in the `package.json` file, you'll see one of the library dependencies called `webpack`. If you're interested in learning more about what Webpack is and how it works behind the scenes, take a look through the [Webpack configuration documentation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/).

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

_If you are finished with the functionality and testing of your project_, then you can consider deploying your project to the web! This way anyone can play it without cloning down your repo.

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a great way to deploy your project to the web. Don't worry about this until your project is free of bugs and well tested!

If you _are_ done, you can follow [this procedure](./gh-pages-procedure.md) to get your project live on GitHub Pages.

## Installing Typescript (*Extension Only*)
1. Install `typescript` and `ts-loader`:
```
npm i -D typescript ts-loader
```

2. Create a `tsconfig.json` file in the root directory
```
touch tsconfig.json
```

3. Add the following to the `tsconfig.json` file:
```js
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "./dist/",
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "module": "es6",
    "target": "es5",
    "allowJs": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node"
  }
}
```

4. In your webpack.config.js file, update it to be:
```js
const path = require('path');
module.exports = {
  "mode": "none",
  "entry": "./src/scripts.ts",
  "output": {
    "path": __dirname + '/dist',
    "filename": "bundle.js",
  },
  devServer: {
    static: {
      directory: path.join(__dirname, 'dist')
    }
  },
  "devtool": "source-map",
  // CSS and file (image) loaders
  "module": {
    "rules": [
      {
        test: /\.css$/i,
        use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader'],
      },
      {
        test: /\.(png|svg|jpg|gif)$/,
        use: [
          {
            loader: 'file-loader',
            options: {
              name: '[name].[ext]',
              outputPath: 'images/',
              publicPath: 'images/'
            }
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        test: /\.tsx?$/,
        use: 'ts-loader',
        exclude: /node_modules/,
      }
    ]
  },
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['.tsx', '.ts', '.js'],
  },
};
```

5. Update all `.js` files to be `.ts` including `scripts.ts`.

6. From here, you should now get some TypeScript errors when running `npm start` that you can begin working through.
